    <p>In a post-pandemic world, most of our views surrounding travel have changed drastically over recent years. From taking the ability to visit people and places around the world for granted to feeling trapped within the walls of our own homes, we have all experienced the extreme freedoms of travel and lack thereof. This interactive set of visualizations aims to demonstrate how the quantity of US travel has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the converse.</p>
    <br>
    <p>People in the United States need to get around to different places in the world, whether that be for a business trip, seeing family and friends, or a relaxing vacation. One of the most popular forms of distance travel is through flights, with 16,405,000 flights taking off annually and 2,900,000 passengers flying in and out of the 19,633 U.S. airports every day (Federal Aviation Administration). The visualization below displays the progression of total flights and flight passengers in the U.S., which can be filtered out by domestic and international flights, from 2003 to 2021:</p>

    <p>As you can see, the popularity of air travel slowly increased over time, as more and more U.S. passengers hopped onto flights to travel around the world... up until the year of 2020.</p>

    <h3>Only the Beginning</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In December of 2019, rumors of a mysterious new illness circled the news. Because cases of the pneumonia-like disease were concentrated in a single region, the general public kept up travel through the holiday season. However, as the disease spiraled into a pandemic, travel slowed to a near halt. </p>
        <br>
        <b>Here are some key dates from the CDC in early stages of the pandemic:</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>January 23, 2020</b>
        <p>Wuhan, China is placed under lockdown due to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus outbreak.</p>        
        <br>
        <b>January 28, 2020</b>
        <p>CDC issues a Level 3 Travel Health Notice— advising travelers to avoid all non-essential travel to China due to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus outbreak.</p>        
        <br>
        <b>February 11, 2020</b>
        <p> WHO announces the official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 Novel Coronavirus outbreak: “COVID-19.” The new name of this disease is an abbreviated version of “Coronavirus Disease 2019.”</p>        
        <br>
        <b>March 11, 2020</b>
        <p>After more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and 4,291 deaths, the WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic.</p>
        <br>
        <b>March 13, 2020</b>
        <p>The Trump Administration declares a nationwide emergency and issues an additional travel ban on non-U.S. citizens traveling from 26 European countries due to COVID-19.</p>    </p>

    <p>After COVID-19 hit the United States, most of the country issued lockdown orders, telling their citizens to stay indoors unless absolutely necessary. These mandates included bans on indoor dining, public entertainment, in-office work, and had many other effects on public services.</p>
    <p><b>This mandate was put into place on April 17, 2020.</b></p>
    <br>

  <div>
    <h3>The Pandemic Goes On</h3>
    <p>As months passed, it became more and more apparent that this pandemic would last a while. COVID-19 completely changed the way the world operates. Work from home is now a standard, while grocery and food delivery services are not only a health necessity, but a convenience standard. The visualization below shows the average number of times residents left their homes each day compared to COVID-19 outbreaks around the US. Notice how peaks of COVID-19 cases take place near the holiday season - November through January. Also, notice how the reaction to COVID-19 spikes changes over the 2 year span.</p>

    <h3>Travel Spikes with the Holidays</h3>
    <p>As COVID-19 progressed, there was still a large population of individuals who found travel essential. Regardless of world events, the months of November through January consistently tend to have an increased level of travel in the United States. This fluctuation of travel typically stems from the larger number of multinational festivals and holidays, both secular and religious, which take place during the late fall and early winter. With these landmark events commonly valuing the unity of family, this leads to a noticeable increase in air travel in addition to the standard travel for work and vacation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Notice that the average amount of travel in the United States during the holiday seasons from 2019-2022 appeared to be lower than the average travel seen in the prior year of 2018. The largest of this difference appears to be from 2020-2021, which happens to be the first holiday season where the CDC restricted travel. While the 2019-20 holiday season marks the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were not yet restrictions on public travel.</p>

    <h3>Nearing the End?</h3>
    <p>Although individual states were allowed to make their own lockdown timeline, many of the states lifted their bans between the <b>end of April and the end of May</b>. Flights and transportation took a big hit during the lockdown and travel decreased along with COVID-19 numbers. However, once the lockdown ended, the amount of travel climbed toward regular numbers and COVID-19 numbers started to increase consistently once again.
        <br>
        <br>
        On <b>April 18, 2022</b>, the national mask mandate in the United States was lifted. This meant that the CDC could no longer require masks on public transportation and at transportation hubs. Where people were protected during their travel before, activities like taking the bus, riding the subway or especially flying came with new risks. The number of new COVID-19 cases being reported was at an all-time low since Covid-19 had hit its peak. People were ready to get out again. When the mask mandate was lifted, people took this as a sign that all was well. It's time to return to normal! <b>The number of people flying spiked, which resulted in COVID-19 cases increasing once again, even after it's all-time low record in cases.</b>

    <h3>Tying It All Together</h3>
    <p>From the visualizations above, we can conclude from the data that there is a visible correlation between increased air travel (especially during the holiday season) and the rise of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Flying to different places, whether that be to see family and friends or to conduct business, is both a fun and necessary activity, but we should all make an effort to practice staying healthy and stopping the spread of sickness while we're doing it.</p>
